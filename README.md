<h3>Check a matrix is symmetric or not? </h3> 

In linear algebra, a symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose. Formally, Because equal matrices have equal dimensions, only square matrices can be symmetric. The entries of a symmetric matrix are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal.

Example 1:  
-----------------------
 - input       output
  1 2 3         1 4 7
  4 5 6         2 5 8
  7 8 9         3 6 9
  
It is not a symmetric matrix. Cause, New matrix is not looks like same of the given matrix

Example 2:
-----------------------
 - input       output
  1 0 0         1 0 0
  0 1 0         0 1 0 
  0 0 1         0 0 1

It is a symmetric matrix. 

<h3>And make a right shift of all the elements of an array </h3>

Input: 
5
1 2 3 4 5 

Output 
5 1 2 3 4
