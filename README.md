<h3>Check a matrix is symmetric or not? </h3> 

In linear algebra, a symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose. Formally, Because equal matrices have equal dimensions, only square matrices can be symmetric. The entries of a symmetric matrix are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal.

Example 1:  
----------
 - input       <br>
  1 2 3        <br>
  4 5 6        <br>
  7 8 9        <br>
  
  - output     <br>
  1 4 7        <br>
  2 5 8        <br>
  3 6 9        <br>
   
   
   
It is not a symmetric matrix. Cause, New matrix is not looks like same of the given matrix

Example 2:
-----------------------
 - input        <br>
  1 0 0         <br>
  0 1 0         <br>
  0 0 1         <br> 
  
  
 - output       <br>
  1 0 0         <br>
  0 1 0         <br>
  0 0 1         <br>
  

It is a symmetric matrix. 

<h3>And make a right shift of all the elements of an array </h3>

Input: 
5
1 2 3 4 5 

Output:  
5 1 2 3 4
